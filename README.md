# Data Comparison

`ckanext-datacomparison` is a CKAN plugin replacing the original _Data Explorer_.
This extension is inspired by the _Data Explorer React_ ([https://github.com/datopian/ckanext-dataexplorer-react](https://github.com/datopian/ckanext-dataexplorer-react)).

The main feature of `ckanext-datacomparison` is the capability to compare data across resources.

The following view plugins are part of `ckanext-datacomparison`:
- `datacomparison_view` the view plugin providing the feature of comparing data across resources
- `datacomparison_explorer_view` a view plugin acting like the _Data Explorer_ using the same code basis as the comparison view
